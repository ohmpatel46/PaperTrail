    "abstract": "We investigate on-device inference techniques for edge AI, focusing on quantization, neural processing units (NPUs), and sparsity to reduce latency and energy consumption. Experiments on Snapdragon-class hardware demonstrate efficient embeddings and retrieval for offline applications, with case studies in mobile computer vision and text ranking."
