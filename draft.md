**Abstract—** Title: On-Device Embedding + Retrieval System for Offline Research Search on Snapdragon NPU

This project aims to develop a compact and efficient embedding + retrieval system that can be deployed on the Snapdragon NPU, enabling fast and accurate offline research search. The proposed system leverages the NPU's hardware acceleration capabilities to process large-scale embeddings and retrieve relevant documents from a pre-trained model. By minimizing the need for cloud-based computations, this system is designed to provide real-time results in resource-constrained environments, making it suitable for various applications such as knowledge graph search and information retrieval.

## I. Introduction
Here's a potential "Introduction" section:

Offline research search has become increasingly important in various fields, including wildlife conservation and environmental monitoring. However, the growing demand for efficient and accurate search systems is hindered by the limitations of traditional cloud-based approaches, which often rely on high-bandwidth internet connections and require significant computational resources. To address this challenge, researchers have been exploring the potential of edge AI and on-device computing to enable fast and energy-efficient search capabilities.

This work aims to build an on-device embedding + retrieval system specifically designed for offline research search on Snapdragon NPU hardware. By leveraging techniques such as quantization, NPUs, and sparsity, we aim to reduce latency and energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is motivated by the success of edge AI applications in other domains, such as acoustic monitoring for wildlife detection, which has demonstrated the feasibility of efficient and energy-efficient solutions on edge devices. By adapting these techniques to offline research search, we hope to provide a more sustainable and accessible solution for researchers and scientists working with limited computational resources.

## III. Method
**Method**

The proposed system aims to build an efficient on-device embedding + retrieval system for offline research search on Snapdragon NPU. The approach will focus on optimizing the performance of the system while minimizing latency and energy consumption.

**Components**

The system will consist of two primary components: (1) an embedding module, which will generate dense vector representations of input data; and (2) a retrieval module, which will perform similarity searches between these embeddings to retrieve relevant results. The system will utilize the Snapdragon NPU's hardware acceleration capabilities to achieve efficient inference.

**Data Flow**

The system will operate on offline data, which will be pre-processed and stored locally on the device. The embedding module will take in input data (e.g., text queries or images) and generate dense vector representations using a suitable algorithm (e.g., quantized neural networks). These embeddings will then be stored in memory for later retrieval. When a query is made, the system will retrieve the relevant embeddings from memory and perform similarity searches to identify top results.

**Key Decisions**

The key decisions relevant to the user's goal include:

* Choosing an appropriate algorithm for embedding generation (e.g., quantized neural networks, sparse representations)
* Selecting an efficient retrieval method (e.g., nearest neighbor search, k-NN)
* Optimizing the system for latency and energy consumption using techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation
* Ensuring data storage and management is optimized for offline applications
